# Home Task Week 9

The main goal of this hometask is to create web file manager using Servet API and Files NIO
It must have an ability to display directory contents (subdirectories and files), view (if it's possible), create and remove files.

Several steps to do:

1. Download latest [tomcat]{http://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi}
2. Register javax.servlet-api-3.1.0.jar as a lib in your project
3. Create run [configuration]{http://devcolibri.com/4249} (2 point)
4. Implement unimplemented methods :)
